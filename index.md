I am a computer science student at CSUF and I plan to become a video game programmer after I expect to graduate in 2027.

## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 3 Part 1

  This was my second favorite lab, as I had to program a BMR calculator. I have wanted to create some sort of calculator in code, and a BMR calculator is useful for people to calculate gaining weight for bodybuilding, avoid malnutrition for pregnancy, or lose weight for dieting. I enjoyed this lab with the help of my programming partner.

* Lab 7

  This was a fun lab as we had to create a program where anyone could input a street, which usually has signs indicating when someone can park on that street. Despite being a short lab, it took some time to figure out the code. Some signs had a specific time period when someone could park and/or a specific day on a street. It was a fun lab with some brainstorming involved.

* Lab 12

  This was my favorite lab because I was able to create a code where I could make a GIF. The functions of a GIF have always intrigued me as I wondered how an image could be animated without it being a video. Instead, an image is animated in a short loop and is compact. I did not know until now that GIFs are ancient. The first GIF, created in 1987, was of an airplane flying in a blue sky.
